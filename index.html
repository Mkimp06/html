            <h2>SEA TURTLES</h2>
            <p>Sea turtles engage in a variety of behaviors and activities. They spend a significant amount of their lives in the water, where they swim and navigate through the ocean currents. Sea turtles are known for their ability to migrate long distances, often returning to the same nesting beaches where they were born. During nesting season, female sea turtles come ashore to lay their eggs in the sand. This process is known as nesting, and it is a crucial part of the sea turtle life cycle. After the eggs are laid, they are left to incubate in the warm sand, and after a period of time, the hatchlings emerge and make their way to the ocean. Sea turtles also feed in the water, primarily on a diet of seagrass, algae, and jellyfish. Overall, sea turtles play an important role in marine ecosystems and are fascinating creatures to study and observe.</p>
